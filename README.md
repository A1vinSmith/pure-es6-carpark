# Pure es6 park simulator

## Usage
* `npm start` to run eslint on watch mode and dev-server at localhost:8080
* `npm run watch` to only watch for/recompile on changes
* `npm run build` to generate a minified, production-ready build

## TO-DO
1. Select the bus and operate
2. Test Unit

## At the end
In terms of language, pure JavaScript ES6 is ideal.
