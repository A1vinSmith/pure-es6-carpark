# Pure es6 park simulator

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/A1vinSmith/pure-es6-carpark.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

## Usage
* `npm start` to run eslint on watch mode and dev-server at localhost:8080
* `npm run watch` to only watch for/recompile on changes
* `npm run build` to generate a minified, production-ready build

## TODO
1. Test Unit(include DOM, output and utils)

## At the end
In terms of language, pure JavaScript ES6 is ideal.
My original thought to build a simple-redux, but it may to redundant for this. So, I chose closure which I don't need OOP or inheritance, the closure pattern is more reliable than the class pattern. So the answer is clear.
